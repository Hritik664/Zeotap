## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project dives into customer behavior analysis using **Zeotap eCommerce transaction data**. The goal was to segment users based on their purchasing patterns and implement a **Lookalike Model** to recommend products to similar usersâ€”enabling **personalized marketing** and **increased conversion**.

## ðŸ§© Key Features

- ðŸ“Š Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on **customers, transactions, and products**
- ðŸ§  Developed a **Lookalike Recommendation System** based on behavioral features
- ðŸ“Œ Applied **K-means clustering** for customer segmentation
- ðŸ“ˆ Evaluated cluster quality using **Silhouette Score** and **Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI)**

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **SQL** (for data extraction and transformations)
- **Machine Learning** (Unsupervised learning, clustering metrics)

## ðŸš§ Challenges Faced

- Choosing the **optimal number of clusters** for meaningful segmentation
- Ensuring the **recommendation system** aligned with **real-world business insights**

## ðŸ“¢ Business Impact

- Enabled targeted marketing by **grouping users** with similar behaviors
- Improved engagement through **personalized recommendations**
